            <p id="Me"><span class="tab"></span>Hi, my name is Usaamah Amjad and I am a computer programming student at
                Seneca
                College.
                I previously studied at York University
                for Mechanical Engineering but wanted to change programs and chose Seneca College for further studies. I
                was
                born and raised in Toronto, Ontario, but my
                parents are from Pakistan. I have gone back a few times and enjoyed my time there, however, I would love
                to
                travel to Japan and Korea as well.
                <br><br><span class="tab"></span>I am 6'6 and love playing basketball and volleyball in my free time.
                Most
                of my
                time is spent either playing one of these
                activities with friends or playing video games. My favourite video game would be either Apex Legends or
                League
                of Legends (commonly known as LoL).

            <span class="tab"></span>Overall, my experience in the course was amazing. The lectures were very
            informative, and Professor Navreet did a
            great job explaining the different concepts. I was able to grasp the learning material quickly because the
            lectures were taught in a way that
            can help even a beginner with no prior knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The assignments also just
            further enhanced the amount of material
            I was able to learn with a more hands-on approach. Not only did the assignments help with me taking the
            concepts learned in class and applying
            them on VS Code but it also helped with visualizing what my code was doing. I was able to see what each line
            of code was doing to my website and
            where to fix an error if there was one.<br>
            <span class="tab"></span>A few concepts that I learned in this course include, creating a website that can
            alert and prompt a user for values,
            website design such as the layout and responsiveness, also how to create a form that can ask the user to
            input values and submit it. Another
            concept that I learned in the course was something called ElectronApp. This was a very new concept that I
            never knew before and was interesting
            to use and see in practice.<br>
            <span class="tab"></span>These concepts learned in WEB222 will help me in better understanding the next
            course WEB322 and in the future, if I
            decide to go into web development for my career.
